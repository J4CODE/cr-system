## Quick and Brief Summary
"I developed this cannabis regulatory system using the MERN stack, with React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The project features a comprehensive set of functionalities, including user authentication, CRUD operations for managing plants, packages, products, and licenses, as well as seed-to-sale tracking from seed to retail point of sale.

For the frontend, I utilized Vite for a fast development setup and Material UI for styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface. I also implemented React Router for seamless navigation and protected routes for secure access control.

On the backend, I leveraged Express for creating RESTful APIs and integrated MongoDB Atlas for scalable cloud storage.

This project demonstrates my ability to build and deploy full-stack applications, manage state and authentication, and ensure a smooth user experience with responsive design and efficient routing."
